1. Flask App Development

What to Learn:

    Flask basics: Routing, templates, forms, and handling requests.
    Middleware and app configuration.
    Database integration (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB).
    RESTful API creation.
    Authentication and Authorization.
    Frontend integration using Flask with Bootstrap or React/Vue.js.

Practice Project: Build a Data Analysis Dashboard:

    Users can upload datasets (CSV/Excel).
    The app processes and visualizes data using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
    Features include:
        Data cleaning and basic transformations.
        Summary statistics.
        Interactive visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs).
        Saving reports.

2. Data Science

What to Learn:

    Python data manipulation libraries: Numpy, Pandas.
    Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
    Machine Learning basics: Scikit-learn.
    Advanced techniques: Deep learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional).
    Statistics and probability.
    Data wrangling and preprocessing techniques.

Practice Project: Develop a Predictive Analytics App:

    Train a machine learning model (e.g., predict house prices, detect spam, etc.).
    Build an API in Flask that serves predictions.
    Frontend input for users to submit data and get predictions.
    Save model outputs and logs.

3. Integrated Learning

Combine Flask and Data Science in a single project to reinforce both skill sets.

Project Idea: Flask + Data Science

    "Personal Expense Tracker with Analysis":
        Allow users to add their daily expenses.
        Perform analysis on spending trends (e.g., category-wise expenditure, monthly trends).
        Generate visual insights and predictions (e.g., forecasting future expenses).
        Allow exporting reports as PDFs.

Steps to Implement:

    Backend (Flask):
        Create endpoints for adding, retrieving, and analyzing expenses.
        Set up a database to store data.
    Data Science:
        Write scripts for expense categorization and trend analysis.
        Integrate machine learning for forecasting expenses.
    Frontend:
        Build a user-friendly interface for data input and visualizations using Flask templates or a JS framework.

4. Side-by-Side Practices

    Code Challenges: Solve Python/Flask/Data Science problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Kaggle.
    Open Source: Contribute to Flask-based or data science projects on GitHub.
    Mini-Projects:
        Build a Flask app to scrape and visualize news articles.
        Create a sentiment analysis tool for tweets using Flask and Scikit-learn.

Tools to Use:

    VS Code/Jupyter Notebook: For coding and data science.
    Postman: For testing Flask APIs.
    Heroku/Render: To deploy Flask apps.
    Kaggle Datasets: For hands-on practice with real-world data.
    GitHub: To track your progress and share your projects.

Recommended Learning Path

    Alternate between Flask and Data Science tutorials to avoid burnout.
    Apply new concepts to your ongoing projects.
    Use online resources like:
        Flask Documentation
        Kaggle Learn
        Python for Data Science courses on Coursera or Udemy.
